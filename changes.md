It looks like my knowledge of statistics is non-existant. Cp and Cpk which I was going to base calculation on, are useless for the probability purpose. I took it from industrial production and they are use for something different.

Thus, I have to change main assumption and re-write what I have done so far.

Instead of Cp and Cpk, I will jump into half-normal distribution and probability density function, Z-transformation and error function.

I will be strugling with a basic statistics.
